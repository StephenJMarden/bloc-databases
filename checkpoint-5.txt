!=, In a database of books, if you were trying to select all books that were NOT titled 'Redwall' (title != 'Redwall')
<>, If you were selecting clothing sizes from your clothing database, you could use this operator to select all sizes besides (greater than and less than) size 4 (size <> 4)
LIKE, If you had a database of movies, but you could only remember that the title had the word October in it, you could use LIKE to select movies containing that part of the title (title LIKE %October%)
BETWEEN, When selecting a length of wood from your company inventory database, you want to select only pieces between 4 and 8ft (length BETWEEN 4 AND 8)
IS DISTINCT FROM, If you would like to select pets from your shelter database that were not adopted a certain number of days ago, but some animals may not yet be adopted and thus the value will be NULL,
    you can use IS DISTINCT FROM to specify (daysSinceAdoption IS DISTINCT FROM 10)
IS TRUE / IS FALSE, In your satellite database, you would like to find satellites that are still operational. However, some may not have launched yet (and will contain NULL values) so you want
    to use IS TRUE to find operational satellites (operational IS TRUE)
IS NULL, If you were cleaning up your personal CD collection database, but had added a column for purchase date since entering some of the information originally, you would want to use IS NULL
    to find which items need to have their purchase dates entered in, and not include ones which you have entered with this column already since creating it (purchase_date IS NULL);
AND, If you were searching for shirts in a clothing database, you may want to search for shirts that are both yellow and in your size (color = 'Yellow' AND size = 'M')
OR, If you were searching a movie showing database, but hadn't yet decided between two movies you wanted to watch, you could use OR to search for and return
    both the results (title = "Black Panther" or "Ant Man")
NOT, You are searching a poster database for posters you may like, but you HATE pink posters. So you could use the NOT command to search for posters whose color isn't pink (NOT color = 'Pink')
